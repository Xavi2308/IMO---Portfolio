WITH primera_empresa AS (
  SELECT id as company_id FROM companies ORDER BY created_at ASC LIMIT 1

SET company_id = (SELECT company_id FROM primera_empresa)
WHERE company_id IS NULL;

-- 4. ACTUALIZAR VARIACIONES SIN COMPANY_ID
WITH primera_empresa AS (
  SELECT id as company_id FROM companies ORDER BY created_at ASC LIMIT 1
)
UPDATE variations 
SET company_id = (SELECT company_id FROM primera_empresa)
WHERE company_id IS NULL;

-- 5. ACTUALIZAR OTROS DATOS SI EXISTEN
-- Sales
UPDATE sales 
SET company_id = (SELECT id FROM companies ORDER BY created_at ASC LIMIT 1)
WHERE company_id IS NULL AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM companies);

SET company_id = (SELECT id FROM companies ORDER BY created_at ASC LIMIT 1)
WHERE company_id IS NULL AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM companies);

       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE company_id IS NOT NULL) as con_empresa,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE company_id IS NULL) as sin_empresa
FROM products;

SELECT 'VARIACIONES DESPU√âS' as tipo,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE company_id IS NOT NULL) as con_empresa,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE company_id IS NULL) as sin_empresa
FROM variations;

-- 7. MOSTRAR PRODUCTOS POR EMPRESA
SELECT c.name as empresa, COUNT(p.*) as productos 
FROM companies c
LEFT JOIN products p ON c.id = p.company_id 
GROUP BY c.id, c.name
ORDER BY c.created_at ASC;
